## Java Spring Boot REST API Project

My Java project is a Spring Boot REST API implementation using Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL database. The application follows a three-layer architecture with a Controller layer (API layer), Service layer, and Repository layer.

The Controller layer handles the Spring MVC REST APIs, serving as the entry point for incoming requests. The Service layer contains the business logic, while the Repository layer manages database interactions with MySQL.

The project aims to create CRUD REST APIs for user management, covering tasks such as user creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. By utilizing IntelliJ IDEA, we configure the Spring Boot project and integrate MySQL. Postman Rest client is used for API testing.

This project demonstrates practical skills in Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, and showcases the ability to build scalable and maintainable RESTful APIs. It serves as a valuable addition to my proficiency as a Java developer and web technology enthusiast.
